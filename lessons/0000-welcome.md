# Welcome to BASIClings
Welcome! I presume you are here to learn advanced TI-BASIC optimization. You will do this through a series of optimization puzzles, each mirroring a real-world scenario. In each lesson, you'll be presented with an unoptimized program, and you must reduce the program's byte count past a certain threshold to proceed. Along the way, we will cover underutilized techniques and solidify the strategies you probably already know.

This course is relatively straightforward at the outset, but the difficulty will increase rapidly. The purpose of this is not to discourage you! You have the freedom to solve our problems however you'd like. Still, you'll get more out of BASIClings by solving the problems alone, without the use of external help (besides a calculator, of course).

Sometimes, if your program does not exactly match one of my solutions, it will be subjected to behavior testing through CEmu. This course emphasizes programming for the TI-84+CE and covers tokens available only on that calculator.

Feel free to contact me (iPhoenix) if you find yourself struggling too much with any particular problem; there's a fair chance I can use your experiences to improve the course!
